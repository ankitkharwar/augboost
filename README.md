# AugBoost
Gradient Boosting Enhanced with Step-Wise Feature Augmentation. The code in this repository is based heavily on scikit-learn's 'gradient_boosting.py'. We started this as a fork of sklearn, but split away when we saw it would be more convenient. Thanks! =]
Meanwhile, only the code for classification tasks works.
